# Sets

Sets are a data structure that is unordered and unindexed and can contain one instance of a value

### Creating a Set

```python
data = {1, 2, 3, True}
```

### Accessing a Value

You cannot directly access a value in a set but will instead have to loop the whole set

Sets also do **not** allow you to modify a value

```python
for i in data:
    print(i)
```

### Adding an Item

```python
data.add("test")
```

### Removing an Item

```python
data.remove("test")
```
