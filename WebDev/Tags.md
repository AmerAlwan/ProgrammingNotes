# Tags

## Div Tag

The `<div>` tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. It is used as a container for HTML elements, which can be styled with CSS manipulated with JavaScript

The `<div>` tag does not inherently represent anything. It is instead used to group content so it can be easily stylized using the `class` or `id` attributes, and marking a section of a document as being written in a different language using the `lang` attribute.

#### Example

**HTML Code:**

```html
<div class="shadowbox">
    <p>
        Here's a very interesting note displayed in a lovely shadowed box.
    </p>
</div>
```

**CSS Stylization Code:**

```css
.shadowbox {
    width: 15em;
    border: 1px solid #333;
    box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px #444;
    padding: 8px 12px;
    background-image: linear-gradient(180deg, #fff, #ddd 40%, #ccc);
}
```

**Result:**
